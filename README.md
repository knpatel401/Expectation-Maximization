# Expectation Maximization

This repo contains the code associated with the project described on my [Blog](http://ketanscorner.com) here: [Expectation Maximization](http://ketanscorner.com/?p=1).

The project is a short tutorial designed to help build intuition for how the expectation maximization algorithm works using a simple problem based on real world data.  The data I used for the project was from the national longitudinal survey.  In this repo, I've replaced this data with some manufactured data.
